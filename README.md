# Intrusion Detection System(IDS) Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing and interpreting Intrusion Detection System (IDS) data. The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis using various data processing and visualization techniques.

## Contents

- `IDS.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that contains the analysis and visualizations for IDS data.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohantirumalasetti/Intrusion-Detection-System.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd Intrusion-Detection-System
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
